# Developer Portfolio Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) developer portfolio template to help you bootstrap your site with Ben Elstub's [`developer-portfolio-template`](https://github.com/benelstub/developer-portfolio-template).

This template has been created to give you a quick, simple, and easily customizable starter for your developer portfolio site. I highly recommend you use this site only as a starting point to have some sort of presence on the web. You should seek to customize this as much as possible (or scrap it entirely when you're ready to build by yourself).

Happy coding!

## Getting Started

First, install packages:

```bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun dev
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Customise

Full documentation on customising the template is still under development. However, you'll find TODO comments throughout the code to guide you towards necessary modifications. I recommend using an IDE extension that highlights these comments.

Personally, I prefer [TODO Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)
in VSCode. It provides a clear TODO list view within your IDE, making it easier to locate these comments.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your portfolio is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. The Hobby plan is free and more than enough for this type of site.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
